This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks or not. It aims to promote public safety during the COVID-19 pandemic by automating mask compliance monitoring. The trained CNN model analyzes images or video streams, classifying individuals as "with mask" or "without mask" and can serve as a valuable tool for real-time monitoring in various settings, such as public spaces, workplaces, and healthcare facilities. The project emphasizes accuracy, speed, and user-friendliness to aid in mask-wearing compliance efforts.
